# List of packages to push the future of Dart

- Feature complete package for Redis. [pkg:redis][redis] exists but is not well maintained
- Redlock package for distributed lock for Redis
- ORM for relational and noSQL databases. [pkg:drift][drift] exists but it only supports SQLite and PostgreSQL. However, the PostgreSQL support is not in feature parity with the SQLite support.
